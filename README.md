# DSAI (Data Science and Artificial Intelligence)

Welcome to **DSAI**, a repository that holds all the glory (and struggle) of my Master's degree journey in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence. It's a mix of research, projects, and late-night coding sessions, with just the right amount of caffeine-fueled genius. ðŸŽ“ðŸ¤–â˜•

## Whatâ€™s DSAI?

This repository contains everything I've learned, built, and experimented with during my Master's degree. From data wrangling to machine learning models, itâ€™s all here. Think of it as the perfect study guide, except it's a lot more funâ€”and with fewer exams. (Though, let's be honest, those might have been scarier than the AI models.)
