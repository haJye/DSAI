# Solar System Simulation Report

## Overview
This report documents the current implementation of a Solar System simulation using **Pygame** and **OpenGL**. The simulation visualizes celestial objects such as planets, their satellites, asteroid belts, and comets in a 3D environment with lighting, textures, and camera movement.

## Features

### Visuals
- **High-resolution textures (4K):** Applied to planets, the Sun, and other celestial objects to enhance realism.
- **Dynamic lighting:** The Sun serves as a light source, with diffuse and specular lighting affecting the scene.
- **Starry background:** A rotating textured sphere simulates a dynamic starry background.

### Celestial Objects
1. **Planets**
   - Each planet has properties including size, orbit radius, speed, axial tilt, and texture.
   - Nine planets are included (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto).
   - Satellites are defined for Earth and Jupiter.

2. **Satellites**
   - Earth has two satellites defined (textures to be added in the future).
   - Jupiter includes four major satellites (Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto).

3. **Comets**
   - Elliptical orbits for comets (e.g., Halley and Encke).
   - Defined with semi-major and semi-minor axes.

4. **Asteroids**
   - An asteroid belt is included with randomized orbit radii and speeds.

### Dynamic Environment
- **Camera Movement:**
  - Keyboard-controlled camera position (W, A, S, D, arrow keys).
  - Preset camera distances (`R`, `T`, `Y`, `U` keys).

- **Time Scaling:**
  - Adjust time scale (`1` to `4` keys) for orbit speeds.

- **Interactive Modes:**
  - Pause or resume time (`0` key).
  - Camera reset options.
- **Quit**
  - Terminate program with `ESC` key.


### Future Enhancements
- Support for toggling fullscreen and windowed modes.
- Addition of planetary rings with textures (e.g., Saturn).
- Enhanced satellite visuals with specific textures.
- Improved comet tails and asteroid belt density.

## Technical Details

### Libraries Used
- **Pygame:** Manages the main event loop, keyboard inputs, and sound effects.
- **PyOpenGL:** Handles 3D rendering, including lighting, textures, and transformations.

### Key Functionalities
1. **Texture Loading**
   - `load_texture`: Loads and applies 2D textures to celestial objects.

2. **Sphere Rendering**
   - `draw_sphere`: Generates textured spheres using OpenGLâ€™s `gluSphere`.

3. **Saturn Rings Rendering**
   - `draw_rings`: Creates quad-strip-based rings for Saturn.

4. **Comet Orbits**
   - Implements elliptical orbit paths with adjustable semi-major and semi-minor axes.

### Event Handling
- **Keyboard Events:**
  - Camera controls and time scaling handled through `KEYDOWN` events.

## Assets

### Textures
- **Planets:** High-resolution images (`earth.jpg`, `moon.jpg`, etc.) stored in the `textures4k` directory. And also including `textures2k` for 2K images.
- **Stars:** Background image simulating outer space.

### Audio
- **Background Music:** A looping MP3 file (`music/main.mp3`) provides ambiance.

---

## Known Issues
- **Performance:** High-resolution textures may impact performance on less powerful hardware.
- **Fullscreen Mode:** Currently fixed in fullscreen; toggling to windowed mode is not implemented.
- **Lighting:** Intensity can sometimes oversaturate specific textures.

## Conclusion
The Solar System simulation provides an interactive 3D environment showcasing celestial mechanics. Future iterations aim to enhance realism and interactivity, building on the robust framework established in this version.
